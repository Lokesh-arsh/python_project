# python_project
This project analyzes job postings data to identify the top in-demand technical skills and how their popularity has changed month by month over the last year. Using Python, Pandas, and Plotly, it cleans and transforms the data, extracts key trends, and visualizes the top 5 skills by their share of total job postings.
